 <p style="font-size: 18px"<FontSmall</p> Mona is by far the best 4 star Character you can get in the game and the fact that you are given a free Mona right from the start makes your early game run by fater. The best relics to run on mona would be the Hades set which gives her Life steal with every hit she does, which complements her skill set which is AOE basically making her almost unbeatable.

<p style="font-size: 18px"<FontSmall</p> LiLing is a fighter character which means that he is meant to do high damage to the enemy team. What you should build on him should be either the Hades set or the War set for the extra damage as well as some crit sub stats. LiLing is great for boss battles as well as story because of his aoe damage as well as being able to heal himself.

  <p style="font-size: 18px"<FontSmall</p> ChangPu is a great healer to have on your team for the early game for really strong heals for a single unit or a more spread out heal with her ultimate. For her relics you will have to run the Abiding Pancea set to make her healing much more stronger, you will also want to have defence sub stats to make her survive longer to keep your other characters alive.

<p style="font-size: 18px"<FontSmall</p> Lin Xiao is a damage dealer that is great in many thing such as farming for relics and also some story, her damage is great but you have to keep her alive with another characters healing. You have to build the war set on her so her damage will become stronger as well with some crit substats
